"""Packaging regression tests for pdomain-ops.

These assert invariants about how the project is *packaged*, not about the
running library.

Regression guard for the ``py.typed`` marker: hatchling only ships
``pdomain_ops/py.typed`` if the file exists in the package directory. If it
is ever deleted (or excluded by a future build-config change), downstream
consumers stop seeing pdomain-ops as a typed package and every imported
symbol degrades to ``Any`` under basedpyright/mypy. The sibling
``pdomain-book-tools`` ships its marker correctly; this test keeps
pdomain-ops aligned.
