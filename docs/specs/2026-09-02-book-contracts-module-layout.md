# Book Contracts Module Layout

The extraction design grouped the package by each module's responsibility. It
measured 12,998 lines at the time, rather than grouping code by the package
that had previously held it.

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** spec
- **Status:** draft
- **Owner:** CT
- **Last verified:** 2026-11-07
- **Read when:** performing the reorganisation commits of the book-contracts extraction, or deciding where a new contract belongs.
- **Search terms:** book contracts layout, module structure, package reorganisation, extraction target.

## Why this exists

The [extraction plan](../plans/2026-09-01-extract-book-contracts-and-retire-pd-repos.md)
lands each move as two commits: the files moved verbatim, then reorganised. The
second commit needs something to reorganise toward. This is it.

Without a target layout, each step would invent one, and the package would end
up with the same accidental shape it has today.

## The layout

```text
pdomain_book_contracts/
    annotation/      provenance.py, roles.py, page_kind.py, mappings.py
    geometry/        point.py, bounding_box.py
    text/            label_normalization.py, text_normalize.py
    typography/      labels.py, spans.py, normalization.py, records.py,
                     annotations.py, exchange.py, book_manifest.py, review.py
    matching/        alignment.py, engine.py, models.py, legacy_projection.py,
                     pgdp_continuations.py, match_type.py, character_groups.py
    ocr/             character.py, glyph_annotations.py, provenance.py,
                     review.py, gt_orphans.py, blob_protocol.py
    layout/          types.py, regions.py
    sources/pgdp/    rounds.py, offsets.py,
                     f2/{tokens,parser,project_rules,warnings}.py
    licensing.py
    _schemas.py
```

## What moved and why

Four changes are deliberate. Everything else keeps its name.

**All alignment lives in `matching/`.** `typography/alignment.py`, 812 lines,
moves beside the matching engine. It aligns two texts, which is what `matching/`
is for, and it currently sits in `typography/` only because it was written for
typography's first consumer. The two stdlib enum modules it depends on,
`match_type.py` and `character_groups.py`, come from `ocr/` for the same reason:
they are matching vocabulary, not OCR results.

**Text transformation gets its own package, but normalization stays put.**
`ocr/text_normalize.py` and `ocr/label_normalization.py` move to `text/`. Both
import nothing but the standard library, so `text/` genuinely has no internal
dependencies.

`typography/normalization.py` stays in `typography/`. An earlier draft of this
spec moved it to `text/` on the grounds that it was not about typography
specifically. That was wrong. It imports `KnowledgeState` and `StyleLabel` from
`typography/labels.py`, and `CanonicalModel`, `StyleSpan` and `split_graphemes`
from `typography/spans.py`, while `typography/records.py` imports
`ComparisonOperation` back from it. Moving it created a genuine import cycle
that failed at run time with a partially initialized module. It is built out of
typography vocabulary, so `typography/` is where it belongs.

**The round container separates from the F2 markup.** `pgdp/f2/offsets.py`
contains no reference to F2 markup at all. It reads the round-JSON container, a
JSON object mapping page keys to page text, and tracks byte offsets into it.
Every PGDP round shares that container; only the markup inside differs.

`pdomain-source-data` already relies on this. It reads P3 with
`read_lexical_f2_index` and `read_lexical_f2_page`, then compares the two rounds
to decode words split across a page break. The functions are named for F2 and
used for P3.

So `offsets.py` moves up beside `rounds.py`, out of `f2/`, and its functions
lose the `f2` in their names. The `f2/` package keeps only what is genuinely
F2-specific: tokens, the markup parser, project rules, and warnings.

There is no `p3.py`. P3 carries no markup, so it needs nothing beyond the shared
container. A module for it would have no contents. A later round parser, or
another source with its own container, plugs in beside `f2/`.

`pgdp_results.py` becomes `rounds.py`, because it reads any round rather than
some thing called a result.

**Two further renames resolve collisions.** `layout/geometry.py` becomes
`layout/regions.py`, because it describes page regions and the name already
means spatial value types one level up. `schemas/_helpers.py` becomes
`_schemas.py` at the package root, since one shared pydantic constant does not
need a package.

`typography/review.py` and `ocr/review.py` keep their names. They are different
things in different packages, and the package prefix distinguishes them.

## Dependency direction

Current cross-package imports, checked on 2026-11-07 in
`pdomain-book-contracts` at `37fa7ec`, are:

```text
_schemas, text               no cross-package dependencies
geometry                     depends on _schemas
layout, licensing            no cross-package dependencies
annotation                   depends on layout
typography                   depends on geometry, _schemas, annotation
ocr                          depends on geometry, text, _schemas, annotation
matching                     depends on geometry, typography
sources/pgdp                 depends on typography
```

The annotation package was added after extraction. `typography/labels.py` and
`ocr/review.py` now import its provenance enums, while
`annotation/mappings.py` imports `layout.types`. Geometry's point and box
modules import `_schemas`. These edges supersede the original dependency
list, which omitted the later annotation package and the geometry-to-schema
edge.

The package import tests and import-boundary tests pass, but they do not
constitute an exhaustive cycle or internal-layer enforcement test. Keep new
imports consistent with these responsibilities and run consumer gates too.

## What this layout does not solve

`matching/legacy_projection.py` used to refer to `Block`, `Page` and `Word`
under `TYPE_CHECKING`, and those classes stay in `pdomain-book-tools`. Resolved
during the `matching/` step with three module-private structural Protocols, so
the package type-checks alone. The surface stayed narrow: three attributes and
one method for words, three and one for lines, three for pages.

The line and page Protocols are generic in the word type. `Block.remove_item`
accepts `Word | Block` rather than `object`, which no non-generic Protocol
parameter can satisfy. This only surfaced when book-tools type-checked against
the concrete classes; the contracts package's own tests could not catch it.

`geometry/bounding_box.py` keeps three back-compat wrapper methods, `refine`,
`crop_top` and `crop_bottom`, whose implementations need cv2 and stay in
book-tools. The first attempt at the move had them import
`pdomain_book_tools.geometry.image_ops` at call time, which is the forbidden
direction and left the three methods raising `ImportError` for anyone who
installed the contracts package alone.

They now dispatch through a provider registry. `image_ops.py` registers itself
at its own import time, and an unregistered call raises a named error saying
what to install. Registration is in `image_ops.py` rather than in
`pdomain_book_tools/geometry/__init__.py` on purpose: putting it in the package
`__init__` would pull cv2 into every `import pdomain_book_tools.geometry`, which
is the weight Step 5 of the extraction plan exists to remove.

`ocr/ground_truth_matching.py`, 1,297 lines, is a legacy shim superseded by
`matching/engine.py` according to its own docstring. It is not part of this
extraction and stays behind. Retiring it is separate work.

## Verifying a reorganisation commit

Each reorganisation commit follows a verbatim move commit. To check one:

1. Every file present before is present after, under its new path.
2. Line counts match per file. A reorganisation renames and re-imports; it does
   not edit bodies.
3. The only content changes are import statements and `__init__` exports.
4. Both repositories pass their gates.
5. The internal dependency direction above still holds.

## Adversarial Review

A source and focused-test review on 2026-11-07 found two stale layout claims:
the package now includes `annotation/`, and the dependency list omitted its
edges plus geometry's dependency on `_schemas`. The layout and list above
now reflect those imports. The provider registry in
`geometry/bounding_box.py` and book-tools `geometry/image_ops.py` still
preserve the intended dependency direction; the generic protocols remain in
`matching/legacy_projection.py`.

Validation: thirteen tests passed across contracts
`tests/test_package.py`, `tests/test_torch_free_import.py`, and
`tests/test_bounding_box_image_ops.py`. These cover public package imports,
absence of heavy imports, and provider behavior. This review did not replay
all historical move commits, remeasure line counts, or run every consumer's
full gate. The linked extraction plan remains open because data rescue and
retirement outcomes have not been established. This is the current review,
not evidence that a review existed when the spec was first written.
