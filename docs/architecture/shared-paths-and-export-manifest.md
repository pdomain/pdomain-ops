# Shared paths and DocTR export manifests

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** architecture
- **Status:** built
- **Read when:** changing suite path discovery or the shared DocTR export format.
- **Search terms:** shared paths, shared-paths.json, DocTR export manifest, atomic write.

## Shared-path registry

Suite applications publish and resolve named filesystem paths through
`shared-paths.json` in the suite data directory. A bounded file lock and atomic
replacement protect updates. As a result, concurrent publishers do not expose
partial JSON. The public suite package exports the path helper, the publish and
resolve functions, and the lock-timeout exception.

When publishers use the same key, the last writer wins. Resolving an absent key,
missing registry, invalid JSON, or a non-object JSON root returns `None`.
The reader does not validate the full registry shape: a truthy non-object
`paths` value can raise instead of returning `None`. Resolution returns a
published path even when the target no longer exists. The consumer decides
whether that stale path is usable. Lock timeout precedence is the explicit
argument, then `PDOMAIN_SHARED_PATHS_LOCK_TIMEOUT`, then the five-second default.

## Export manifest

The shared Pydantic models describe DocTR export metadata and task statistics.
Manifest reads validate JSON against those models. Writes use a temporary file
and `os.replace`. Consumers therefore see either the old complete manifest or
the new one. The schema emitter includes the public manifest models.

The JSON key `schema` maps to the Python field `schema_id`. Unknown model fields
are ignored for forward compatibility. A manifest version greater than 1 is
parsed with a warning rather than rejected. Callers choose whether that newer
version is acceptable. A missing manifest returns `None`. Corrupt JSON or model
data raises `ValueError`.

## Ownership and non-goals

`pdomain-ops` owns the filesystem exchange contract and public schema models.
Publishers decide which paths and manifests to expose. Consumers decide whether
a published path or newer manifest version is usable. The registry is not a
service-discovery network. The manifest is not a remote job protocol.

The schema emitter is the supported producer boundary for these public models.
Consumers should not duplicate model introspection or infer schema membership
from internal modules.

- **Verified:** 2026-11-07 by reading the code and focused tests above. Corrupt
  JSON and non-object roots have tests; malformed nested `paths` values do not.
