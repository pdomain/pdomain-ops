# Shared suite services

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** architecture
- **Status:** built
- **Read when:** changing suite device or update routes, desktop launch helpers,
  preferences, single-instance behavior, shared paths, or public schemas.
- **Search terms:** suite services, device routes, update routes, desktop,
  single instance, shared paths, schema emitter.

The shared suite services set boundaries for devices, updates, desktop launch,
single-instance state, paths, and schemas.

## Device and preference boundary

The device service exposes `GET` and `PUT /api/suite/device`. In local mode,
`GET` reports discovered devices. It resolves the effective target in this
order: application override, suite default, then automatic selection. `PUT`
sets or clears an application or suite preference. Outside local mode, `GET`
reports the mode without enumerating hardware. `PUT` still writes or clears
the preference before returning that mode-only response. The mode check does
not prevent preference changes.

Device discovery reports CPU, CUDA, and Apple MPS through shared models. It
also reports detected NVIDIA hardware that PyTorch cannot use, with
`available=False` and a reason. CUDA memory probing can still raise when the
card is full. Local stage dispatch consumes the resolved target; the route
does not run OCR itself.

## Update boundary

The update service exposes `GET` and `POST /api/suite/update`. `GET` compares
the installed distribution with the configured pdomain index. `POST` runs the
guarded upgrade and returns `restart_required`. The service rejects editable
installs with HTTP 409. Subprocess upgrade failures surface as HTTP 502. The
caller owns the restart UX. It also owns update policy, such as notify,
automatic, or manual updates.

The update API is not a background package manager. It does not silently
upgrade an editable checkout, and it does not restart an application inside
the route.

## Desktop and single-instance boundary

The desktop module coordinates launches through injectable seams. These seams
cover server startup, health checking, browser or window opening, tray
integration, port resolution, and single-instance acquisition. Suite helpers
create and remove Linux XDG shortcuts. Shortcut commands launch the application
binary in its default browser mode.

Single-instance state is a locked JSON pidfile outside the installed-app
registry. Reads reap corrupt or dead-process files while treating a
permission-denied PID probe as evidence that the process is alive.

Linux shortcuts are the only shipped platform shortcut implementation. macOS
and Windows shortcut functions raise `NotImplementedError`. The package still
contains optional native window seams. It does not require one desktop UI
transport. It also does not claim that pywebview, Qt, or AppImage is the
suite-wide frontend.

## Path and schema boundaries

Named filesystem exchange and DocTR export manifests are defined in
[`shared-paths-and-export-manifest.md`](shared-paths-and-export-manifest.md).
The public schema emitter provides the supported producer boundary for shared
API and manifest models. Applications own their product-specific schemas. They
also decide which shared paths they publish.

## Evidence

- **Code:** `pdomain_ops/suite/device_routes.py`,
  `pdomain_ops/suite/device_prefs.py`, `pdomain_ops/gpu/device_probe.py`,
  `pdomain_ops/suite/update.py`, `pdomain_ops/suite/update_routes.py`,
  `pdomain_ops/desktop.py`, `pdomain_ops/suite/desktop.py`,
  `pdomain_ops/suite/single_instance.py`, `pdomain_ops/suite/shared_paths.py`,
  `pdomain_ops/schemas/emit.py`
- **Tests:** `tests/suite/test_device_routes.py`,
  `tests/suite/test_device_prefs.py`, `tests/suite/test_update_check.py`,
  `tests/suite/test_update_apply.py`, `tests/suite/test_update_routes.py`,
  `tests/test_desktop_run_windowed.py`, `tests/suite/test_desktop.py`,
  `tests/suite/test_single_instance.py`, `tests/suite/test_shared_paths.py`,
  `tests/test_schemas_emit.py`
- **Salvaged sources:**
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-06-04-pd-suite-desktop-shell-design.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-06-04-pd-suite-desktop-shell-plan.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/runbooks/desktop-launcher-integration.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-06-10-trainer-spa-next-arc.md`
- **Verified:** 2026-11-07 by reading the current code and focused tests above,
  plus `tests/gpu/test_device_probe.py`. The nonlocal `PUT` behavior follows
  from source inspection; the route tests cover nonlocal `GET` only.
