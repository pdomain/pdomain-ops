# Intent map

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** context
- **Status:** active
- **Last verified:** 2026-11-08
- **Read when:** deciding what work remains active, deferred, rejected, or blocked.
- **Search terms:** intent, deferred work, rejected direction, owner decision.

Active work covers isolated ebook sessions, evidence-backed page-model
adoption. The local PGDP review proof is complete. All other items are
completed, deferred, rejected, blocked, or need an owner decision.

The 2026-11-07 verification checked local source, tests, and the open-work
links. External infrastructure and historical cross-repository decisions below
remain scoped to their recorded evidence; this date does not revalidate them.

The 2026-11-08 update verifies only the new PGDP review work and its measured
outcomes. Other entries retain their recorded evidence dates.

## Active bets

- **Maintain isolated ebook sessions — active.** Keep standalone ebook work
  isolated from parent repository instructions. Also isolate it from shared
  working-directory state. Owner: the se-llm-skills or ebook-tool maintainer,
  not pdomain-ops. Route: verify and maintain the procedure in that owning
  repository. Evidence: the red-team ledger found no contradiction in the
  isolation goal. Source mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/se-ebook-isolated-sessions.md`.
- **Complete evidence-backed page-model adoption — active.** Identify only
  consumer gaps that remain in PageRecord, PagePayload, provenance, extensions,
  and persistence. Owner: each consuming pdomain repository. Route: first check
  that repository's code and tests. Record a gap in its intent map only after
  that check. Current pdomain-ops evidence lives in
  [page lifecycle and storage](../architecture/page-lifecycle-and-storage.md).
  Source mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/specs/2026-06-01-page-split-downstream-rollout.md`.

The [lint-deviation catalog](../process/lint-deviations.md) remains a standing
maintenance obligation under `CONVENTIONS.md`; it is not a migration bet.

## Completed work

- **Source text tabs and page refresh — completed locally, 2026-11-08.** Dev14 adds P3, F2 and read-only Consolidated GT with supported formatting and mapped verse indents. Working GT retains current corrections; edits remain in Matches. Nine source pages and installed browser checks passed, including all six tabs after navigation and an API reload resetting generation to zero. Unresolved formatting remains visible. See the [follow-up plan](../plans/2026-11-08-source-tabs-and-page-refresh.md).

- **Real PGDP review and API-driven UI proof — complete locally.** Contracts,
  source-data, the labeler and ops support preparation, native OCR, grouped
  review, live browser control and structured export. The installed build
  completed 152 public operations on nine real pages and passed eight Chromium
  tests. Column negatives and paired-column persistence are verified; two
  verse cases remain partial. See the [P3/F2 plan](../plans/2026-11-08-p3-f2-review-api.md).
  Full-corpus quality, model training and publication remain outside this proof.

- **Clear the basedpyright strict backlog — done.** All 33 baseline diagnostics
  are fixed and the baseline file is deleted. Evidence: commit `f09d2b7` and the
  [lint-deviation catalog](../process/lint-deviations.md). Owner: CT.
- **Remove `desktop._noop_app` — done.** The dead ASGI placeholder is gone.
  Evidence: commit `d73c331`. Owner: CT.
- **Salvaged holding-area migration — done.** All 210 Markdown sources were
  red-teamed. Useful content was promoted to architecture, decisions, and this
  intent map. All 222 tracked holding-area files were retired. Evidence: the
  [red-team ledger](../research/2026-07-13-salvaged-docs-red-team.md) and the
  corpus tombstone in [decisions](decisions.md). Owner: CT. Final disposition:
  retired after preservation. Source mapped: `_tbd/README.md`.

## Deferred work

- **Rebuild behavior capture and templates — deferred.** Derive a
  cross-interface method and scanner-safe templates from current tests. Owner:
  the repository that runs the pilot. Route: start with one Web implementation.
  Verify TUI and CLI lessons in their owning repositories. Sources mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/behavior-e2e-capture.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/behavior-e2e-gotchas.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/templates/behavior-flows.md`, and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/templates/behavior-unit-spec.md`.
- **Pilot docgraph-native documentation and UI inventories — deferred.** Keep
  the inventory-first idea, but use current docgraph metadata and a reduced UI
  contract. Owner: the first repository that requests a pilot. Route: prove one
  inventory and one UI contract. Only then propose a workspace standard.
  Sources mapped: `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/document-existing-repo.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/ui-definition.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/templates/repo-documentation-inventory.md`, and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/templates/ui-unit-definition.md`.
- **Refresh notifications and operational visibility — deferred.** Evaluate a
  low-risk notification loop, cross-tool configuration sync, and
  provider-neutral cost visibility. Owner: workspace tooling, not pdomain-ops.
  Route: start with a needs assessment against current Codex and Claude tools.
  Do not revive the old ctask data model. Sources mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/research/2026-05-21-workspace-agent-tooling-audit.md`
  and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-17-cost-dashboard-redesign.md`.
- **Benchmark OCR, HTR, and dewarp alternatives — deferred.** Compare
  PP-OCRv5 ONNX, HTR engines, historical datasets, and selected dewarp options
  with the shipped DocTR, Tesseract, textline-disparity, and UVDoc baseline.
  Owner: pdomain-book-tools and the OCR training repositories. Route: before
  adoption, require dataset-license review and reproducible metrics. Evidence:
  current dispatch is documented in
  [batched OCR dispatch](../architecture/batched-ocr-dispatch.md). Sources
  mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/research/2026-06-02-ocr-engine-landscape-and-training-datasets.md`
  and `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/research/dewarp/docunet-benchmark.md`.
- **Publish a current project update — deferred.** Replace the unfinished
  pd-* announcement with verified names, install paths, measured quality, and
  current hosted-inference intent. Owner: CT or the project communications
  owner. Route: draft from current repositories and reproducible measurements.
  Source mapped: `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/research/update-post.md`.
- **Finish optional platform and remote adapters on demand — deferred.** Keep
  Windows and macOS packaging, RemotePageStore, managed persistence, Modal,
  shared-container dispatch, and hosted deployment deferred until a consumer
  commits to them. Owner: pdomain-ops owns its protocol seams. Packaging or
  hosted owners own their implementations. Evidence: local scope and explicit
  unsupported seams are documented in
  [batched OCR dispatch](../architecture/batched-ocr-dispatch.md) and
  [page lifecycle and storage](../architecture/page-lifecycle-and-storage.md).
- **Validate product-specific roadmap residue — deferred.** Check current code
  and governed issue reports for open-in-labeler links, PageRecord replacement
  of manifest bridges, simple-GUI managed deployment, missing shared UI
  components, and platform or real-engine coverage. Owner: the affected product
  repository. Route: copy only confirmed gaps into that repository's intent map.
- **Reassess semantic and scheduled review assistance — deferred.** Consider
  semantic review or scheduled cross-repo convention audits only if installed
  plugins leave a measured gap. Owner: workspace tooling. Route: measure the
  unmet need before writing a replacement design.

- **Delete rejected-automation labels on GitHub — deferred.** The retired
  ship-issue bot's branches are gone, but its labels survive: `bot:*`,
  `model:*`, `model-effort:*`, and `recurring:*`, fifteen or more of
  pdomain-prep-for-pgdp's 53. Owner: CT. Route: an outward-facing deletion on
  the remote, so it needs explicit approval before anyone runs it. Evidence: the
  persistent coding-bot is a rejected direction below; surveyed 2026-08-08. The
  eight `wip/ship-issue*` and `worktree-agent-*` branches were deleted on
  2026-08-08 after each was verified redundant against master.

## Rejected directions

- **Parallel archive tree — rejected.** Retired docs are reduced into durable
  architecture, decisions, and residual intent instead of moved under
  `docs/archive/`.
- **Persistent coding-bot and ship-issue system — rejected.** Do not revive the
  custom daemon, rolling WIP branch, state and cost databases, or unattended
  PAT-driven runner. Current practice uses worktrees, plugins, session-scoped
  agents, and human integration. Owner: workspace automation. Route: retain
  only its threat-model and human-gate rationale. Require a new design if a
  concrete need returns.
- **GitHub issue synchronization — rejected.** Do not mirror or synchronize
  governed issue reports into GitHub Issues. Repository-local issue documents
  are the only work-tracking authority. A future read-only export requires a
  new owner-approved design and must not create a second status source.
- **Full historical UI schema as a workspace standard — rejected.** Do not
  require the complete state-matrix, interaction-ID, behavior-ID, and Claude
  Design schema without a successful current pilot. Owner: shared UI process.
  Route: the reduced pilot above is the only retained intent. Draft sources
  mapped: `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/ui-definition.md` and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/templates/ui-unit-definition.md`.

## Blocked (waiting on)

- **Cross-repo release, SHA, and static-security policy — blocked.** Active
  repositories implement many gates, but their release workflows differ. The
  historical universal release-ci claim is false. Owner: workspace release
  maintainers. Blocker: first inventory every active and legacy repo. An owner
  must then decide on required uniformity. Sources mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-06-01-sha-pinning-enforcement.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/python-release-standard.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/static-testing.md`, and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-17-legacy-minimal-scope-strict-linting.md`.
- **External phone-access infrastructure — blocked.** Repository evidence
  cannot confirm current Tailscale, SSH, Termux, tmux, ACL, or credential state.
  Owner: CT. Blocker: inspect the live host, tailnet, and phone. Route: if the
  infrastructure is active, write a current secret-safe runbook. Otherwise,
  retire the old material. Sources mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-14-phone-terminal-access.md`
  and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/specs/2026-05-14-phone-terminal-access-design.md`.
- **Unavailable legacy and external repositories — blocked.** The current
  workspace cannot verify remaining work in se-llm-skills or pd-png-optimizer.
  Owner: each repository owner. Blocker: source access and an owner-confirmed
  lifecycle. Sources mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-17-se-llm-skills-strict-linting.md`
  and
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-17-pd-png-optimizer-strict-linting.md`.

## Needs owner decision

- **Legacy bot workspace support.** Decide whether `/srv/bot-workspaces`, bot
  slots, and related devcontainer permissions still serve current automation.
  Owner: CT and devcontainer maintainers. Evidence: some Makefiles retain the
  filesystem support. The claude-bot, ctask, and ship-issue protocol is stale.
  Source mapped: `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/bot-workspaces.md`.
- **Codex persistence runbook.** Decide whether Codex state still needs an
  owner-maintained backup and restore procedure. Owner: CT and devcontainer
  maintainers. Evidence: `/home/vscode/.codex` remains relevant, but the old
  volume, workspace, and scripts are obsolete. Source mapped:
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/runbooks/codex-devcontainer-persistence.md`.
- **Close or keep the dep-refresh issue.** Commit `7ff9c7d` on 2026-09-13
  deleted the GitHub workflows. On 2026-11-06 GitHub reports that master has
  no branch protection. Thirteen `dep-refresh/*` branches are still on origin.
  The issue's acceptance criteria were not implemented. The file stays.
