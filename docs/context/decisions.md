# Decisions

## Agent Index

- **Kind:** context
- **Status:** active
- **Read when:** checking durable documentation and lifecycle decisions.
- **Search terms:** decisions, retired plan, archive policy, tombstone.

Entries retain their original evidence and dates. The 2026-11-07 revalidation
entry distinguishes current repository evidence from historical claims.

### 2026-07-13 — Retire completed implementation plans

- **Context:** Two plans inferred to be active describe behavior that shipped
  in May and June 2026.
- **Decision:** Delete the plans after promoting their durable behavior to
  [`batched-ocr-dispatch.md`](../architecture/batched-ocr-dispatch.md) and
  [`shared-paths-and-export-manifest.md`](../architecture/shared-paths-and-export-manifest.md).
- **Rationale:** Architecture docs are current truth; completed execution
  checklists are not.
- **Evidence:** Commits `8703224`, `eee600b`, `4111e95`, `4898f33`, `d7209ab`,
  and the source and tests cited by both architecture docs.
- **Remaining work:** Remote OCR batch dispatch remains deferred in
  [`intent-map.md`](intent-map.md).

### 2026-07-13 — Retire the parallel archive tree

- **Context:** `docs/archive/` contained nine empty `.gitkeep` files and no
  documentation.
- **Decision:** Remove the archive scaffold and stop treating archive as a
  lifecycle destination.
- **Rationale:** Docgraph retirement preserves durable truth in architecture,
  decisions, and residual intent. Empty cold-storage folders preserve no
  knowledge and add a competing convention.
- **Evidence:** Owner direction on 2026-07-13 and commit `a603ce9`, which created
  the otherwise-unused scaffold.
- **Remaining work:** none.

### 2026-07-13 — Exclude the salvaged holding area pending triage

- **Context:** `_tbd/` contains 210 tracked Markdown files salvaged from the old
  OCR meta-repository, and its README requires keep-or-delete review.
- **Decision:** Exclude `_tbd/**` from docgraph indexing and reverse-reference
  scans until the owner classifies that corpus.
- **Rationale:** Those files are not wired into pdomain-ops. However, their
  unique historical content makes automatic deletion or lifecycle inference
  unsafe.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/README.md` and the tracked-file count on 2026-07-13.
- **Remaining work:** Resolve the owner-decision item in
  [`intent-map.md`](intent-map.md).

### 2026-07-13 — Red-team salvaged documents before lifecycle action

- **Context:** The 210 tracked Markdown files under `_tbd/` may describe ideas
  that diverge from implementation or current practice. Their historical value
  does not make every document current truth.
- **Decision:** Red-team each document against implementation and current
  practice. Route materially diverged documents to supersession or retirement.
  Do not add conformance headings merely to make a document appear current.
- **Rationale:** Lifecycle status should reflect evidence. Before superseding
  or retiring a diverged source, preserve its useful ideas in the correct
  durable destination. Architecture holds shipped truths, decisions hold
  rationale, and the intent map holds promising unbuilt ideas. Explicitly
  label what did not ship or no longer matches current practice. Do not
  discard a diverged document wholesale.
- **Evidence:** Owner authorization on 2026-07-13.
- **Remaining work:** Review the corpus without migrating or deleting `_tbd/`
  until each document has been red-teamed.

### 2026-07-13 — Bound automation with observable human gates

- **Context:** Historical workspace automation combined schedulers, model
  calls, issue mutation, credentials, and cost tracking in one bot stack.
- **Decision:** Treat the following as portable workspace requirements: least
  privilege, narrow command surfaces, explicit eligibility and blocker checks,
  observable outcomes, bounded budgets, and human escalation. Keep
  deterministic helpers free of hidden model calls.
- **Rationale:** Automation failures remain recoverable when authority and
  transitions are visible and mutation requires an explicit gate.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-09-workspace-foundation.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/specs/2026-05-14-coding-bot-design.md`,
  current `CLAUDE.md`, installed Superpowers skills, and Codex tool permissions.
  Current practice uses Codex collaboration, plugins, and worktrees. These
  replace the Claude/ctask scheduler and its branch, PAT, and model-label
  protocol.
- **Remaining work:** Apply this rationale when designing cross-repo
  automation; it does not define pdomain-ops runtime architecture.

### 2026-07-13 — Pilot risky automation before broad rollout

- **Context:** Earlier bot rollouts used bounded repositories, bake periods,
  stress cycles, and rollback gates before expansion.
- **Decision:** Preserve pilot-first rollout, explicit acceptance criteria,
  bake time, multi-cycle verification, and rollback as portable workspace
  rationale.
- **Rationale:** A narrow pilot exposes operational and security failures before
  they become workspace-wide incidents.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-10-pilot-pd-book-tools.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-11-r4-pd-book-tools-b6-multi-cycle-stress.md`,
  and current `CLAUDE.md` worktree, verification, and integration rules. Current
  practice replaced rollout waves and a rolling WIP branch with per-task
  worktrees and repository-local gates.
- **Remaining work:** Use the principle for future automation changes; do not
  restore the historical bot topology.

### 2026-07-13 — Separate introduced failures from inherited debt

- **Context:** A failing gate may expose old debt or a regression introduced by
  the current change.
- **Decision:** Block changes on introduced failures. Keep inherited failures
  visible and route them to a separate, deduplicated remediation path. Clear
  mechanical failures before judgment-heavy review.
- **Rationale:** This avoids both false blame and silent acceptance of existing
  debt.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-11-r0-lint-first-pr-unblock.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-12-ci-failure-triage.md`, current
  Makefile gates, and the systematic-debugging and verification skills. Current
  practice uses repository-native checks instead of a custom triage bot.
- **Remaining work:** Apply this portable review rule when a baseline already
  fails; it is not permission to waive either failure class.

### 2026-07-13 — Keep issue axes and dependency chains explicit

- **Context:** The salvaged label system separated issue kind, workflow status,
  triage outcome, priority, area, and dependency relationships.
- **Decision:** Preserve those separate concepts as portable workspace
  rationale. Require human approval before issue creation. Keep parent, child,
  and blocker links machine-checkable.
- **Rationale:** Collapsing type, state, and intent makes automation ambiguous
  and can reactivate retired work accidentally.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/architecture/label-taxonomy.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-05-10-feature-request-spec-decomposition-design.md`,
  and current repo guidance to check issue status and in-flight work. Current
  practice uses live `pdomain/*` labels and current tools, not the old
  ConcaveTrillion colors, Claude model labels, or automation tables.
- **Remaining work:** Reconcile the model with live GitHub labels before any
  new machine-readable workspace taxonomy is adopted.

### 2026-07-13 — Keep editable sibling mode explicit and reversible

- **Context:** Local development needs editable siblings, while release and
  dependency truth comes from registries.
- **Decision:** Require an explicit local-mode marker, deterministic sibling
  selection, reversible upgrades, and registry-resolved release validation.
  Dependency refreshes leave a reviewable diff and never commit or push
  silently.
- **Rationale:** Implicit worktree selection and hidden dependency commits make
  builds irreproducible and changes hard to audit.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-05-24-local-dev-standardization.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/specs/2026-05-24-update-pd-deps-design.md`,
  current `scripts/local-dev.sh`, `scripts/local-upgrade-deps.sh`,
  `scripts/update-pdomain-deps.sh`, and Makefile targets. Current practice uses
  `pdomain` commands and `.pdomain-local-mode`, not the old `pd` names.
- **Remaining work:** Keep exact sibling matrices and marker behavior in the
  current scripts rather than duplicating them here.

### 2026-07-13 — Make unpublished sibling validation transient

- **Context:** Testing against sibling source branches can catch integration
  breaks before a package release.
- **Decision:** Keep this validation optional, require a clean tree, and restore
  manifests and lockfiles exactly. Validate Python from Git sources; keep npm
  registry-based unless a deliberate source-build path exists.
- **Rationale:** Transient validation must not rewrite the developer's lasting
  dependency state.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-06-06-git-main-validation-mode.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/ci-against-main.md`, current
  `scripts/ci-against-master.sh`, `scripts/git_master_sources.py`, and
  `scripts/release-common.sh`. Current practice uses `master` naming and
  `VALIDATE_AGAINST_MASTER`.
- **Remaining work:** None for pdomain-ops; other repositories own their
  sibling lists and source-build capabilities.

### 2026-07-13 — Require narrow, documented lint escape valves

- **Context:** Strict checks need exceptions for correct optional imports,
  runtime type imports, generated code, tests, and third-party stub gaps.
- **Decision:** Allow a suppression only when it is scoped, justified inline,
  and recorded in the central deviation catalog. Introduce new scanners as
  advisory until their baseline is clean.
- **Rationale:** An auditable escape valve preserves signal without pretending
  every diagnostic is correct.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/decisions/2026-05-17-strict-linting.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/research/2026-05-17-strict-linting-stack.md`,
  current `pyproject.toml`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, and
  [`lint-deviations.md`](../process/lint-deviations.md). Current practice gates
  recommended-mode errors with `failOnWarnings = false`, not the proposed
  universal warning-failing policy.
- **Remaining work:** Keep the catalog synchronized whenever suppressions or
  config-level ignores change.

### 2026-07-13 — Build reviewable release artifacts and isolate index dispatch

- **Context:** A package build, GitHub release, and package-index refresh are
  related but distinct failure domains.
- **Decision:** Pin managed actions immutably. Derive version truth from package
  metadata, verify artifacts before publishing, and notify indexes separately.
  An index-notification failure does not invalidate an artifact already
  published successfully.
- **Rationale:** Build-once artifacts and isolated dispatch make releases
  reproducible and recoverable.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-06-01-sha-pinning-enforcement.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/pdomain-release-and-index-dispatch.md`,
  current `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `scripts/release-common.sh`, and the
  `pdomain-release-published` receiver in pdomain-index-pip. Current workflows
  do not all contain the old proposed GitHub `release-ci` job; the verified
  local `ci-slow` gate and per-repo workflow are authoritative.
- **Remaining work:** Treat this as portable release rationale; each package
  owns its exact build and publish workflow.

### 2026-07-13 — Route documentation claims by evidence and lifecycle

- **Context:** Source observations, unverified commands, decisions, gaps, and
  future intent require different authority and lifecycle treatment.
- **Decision:** Require evidence for claims and adjudicate contradictions.
  Route shipped truth to architecture, rationale to decisions, and promising
  unbuilt work to intent instead of keeping completed plans as parallel truth.
- **Rationale:** Predictable placement and lifecycle state make retrieval safer
  without discarding useful knowledge.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/document-existing-repo.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/process/doc-claim-audit.md`, current
  `DOCGRAPH.md`, `docgraph.toml`, and the context docs. Current practice uses
  docgraph metadata and checks rather than the old optional-frontmatter folder
  template and archive lifecycle.
- **Remaining work:** Apply this decision to approved `_tbd/` preservation and
  retirement work.

### 2026-07-13 — Write reader-facing prose answer first

- **Context:** Operational readers may be tired, new to the project, or reading
  in a second language.
- **Decision:** Lead with the answer, give each paragraph one idea, use
  descriptive headings and short active sentences, and preserve every fact.
- **Rationale:** Readability reduces review mistakes without trading away
  precision.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-05-28-writing-style-rollout.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/writing-style.md`, the managed readable-output
  block in `AGENTS.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`, and current
  `docs/process/writing-style.md`. Current practice strengthens and manages the
  old standalone rule.
- **Remaining work:** None; keep managed guidance and repo-local prose aligned.

### 2026-07-13 — Separate OCR content from operational page lifecycle

- **Context:** OCR values and persisted page lifecycle have different ownership
  and dependency requirements.
- **Decision:** Keep OCR content in `Page`. Put stable identity, provenance,
  persistence metadata, blob references, and event history in `PageRecord` and
  lifecycle aggregates. Keep application extensions namespaced and JSON-safe.
- **Rationale:** The split avoids package cycles, keeps the foundation model
  portable, and lets lifecycle consumers depend on protocols rather than a
  remote-service assumption.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-05-31-page-record-ops-design.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-06-01-page-record-ops-pdomain-ops.md`,
  current pdomain-book-tools `ocr/page.py` and `blob_protocol.py`, and current
  pdomain-ops `pages/`, `blob_store.py`, `page_aggregate.py`, and tests. Current
  APIs retain compatibility fields and evolved beyond the plan's exact removals.
- **Remaining work:** Promote a focused architecture record if current source
  coverage is not already sufficient in the owning repositories.

### 2026-07-13 — Share stable seams, not specialized application behavior

- **Context:** Reusable UI and ops code serves several applications with
  different workflows.
- **Decision:** Shared packages own primitives, protocols, types, and neutral
  extension points. Applications keep specialized behavior until repeated
  evidence justifies promotion. Shared UI accepts host callbacks instead of
  importing backend ops.
- **Rationale:** Evidence-based promotion avoids coupling every consumer to one
  application's workflow.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-05-16-cross-cut-design.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/plans/2026-06-10-trainer-spa-next-arc.md`, current
  pdomain-ui canvas/primitives exports, pdomain-ops protocols, and consumer
  source. Current practice uses `@pdomain/pdomain-ui` and `pdomain-ops`, not the
  original package names or drop-in design-system bundle.
- **Remaining work:** This is portable workspace rationale; consumer repos own
  decisions to promote additional shared behavior.

### 2026-07-13 — Require consent at local application trust boundaries

- **Context:** Local applications handle filesystem paths, uploaded archives,
  updates, desktop integration, and test data.
- **Decision:** Reject traversal and unsafe paths, separate local authority from
  uploaded data, require explicit consent for persistent mutations and
  upgrades, make launcher installation opt-in, and isolate and purge test data.
- **Rationale:** Local access is powerful. Safe defaults prevent an interface
  convenience from becoming implicit filesystem or system authority.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-05-26-pd-ocr-simple-gui-reconciliation-design.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-06-04-pd-suite-desktop-shell-design.md`,
  current pdomain-ocr-simple-gui source/tests, and pdomain-ops `desktop.py` and
  desktop tests. Current platform support, auth scope, and CLI surfaces differ
  from the salvaged plans.
- **Remaining work:** Keep unsupported platforms or auth capabilities explicit
  in the owning repository's intent map.

### 2026-07-13 — Trace approved behavior through stable records and tests

- **Context:** UI intent, observable behavior, backend effects, and executable
  verification are related but distinct artifacts.
- **Decision:** Separate target definition from behavior capture. Give behavior
  records stable IDs, distinguish observable output from side effects, chain
  flows by record ID, and keep intended-but-unbuilt behavior visibly open.
  Use deterministic fake-dependency CI plus opt-in real-engine verification.
- **Rationale:** Traceable records expose mismatches without duplicating the
  same requirement across flows and tests.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/process/behavior-e2e-capture.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-01-ui-behavior-intent-evidence-design.md`,
  and current pdomain-ocr-simple-gui behavior specs, E2E tests, and scanner
  tests. Current practice must derive ID grammar from scanner tests because old
  multi-segment examples and template IDs caused silent coverage errors.
- **Remaining work:** Treat this as portable testing rationale; publish only a
  scanner-safe template if current consumers still need one.

### 2026-07-13 — Separate image-correction regimes and evaluate dependencies

- **Context:** Coarse orientation, fine skew, perspective, textline curvature,
  page-side detection, and general restoration are different image problems.
- **Decision:** Keep these regimes explicit. Use owned classical geometry as a
  baseline, preserve CPU/GPU parity, and gate expensive neural correction by
  measured need. Treat license, maintenance, weights, runtime, and CLI
  boundaries as adoption criteria.
- **Rationale:** A single correction label hides incompatible algorithms,
  licensing risks, and performance costs.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/specs/2026-06-02-geometry-correction-design.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/research/2026-06-02-deskew-dewarp-backend-options.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/research/dewarp/uvdoc.md`, and current geometry and
  dewarp code/tests in pdomain-book-tools. Current practice selected a narrower
  stack than the survey and did not adopt every benchmark candidate.
- **Remaining work:** This is portable OCR rationale; benchmark rankings and
  dependency health require fresh evidence before new adoption.

### 2026-07-13 — Execute cross-repository renames as phased migrations

- **Context:** Public renames affect repositories, packages, indexes,
  consumers, local paths, automation, external identities, and release events.
- **Decision:** Sequence those surfaces with acceptance scans, smoke installs,
  redirect checks, and rollback. Exclude historical fixtures, retired repos,
  and audit records from blind replacement.
- **Rationale:** A staged migration preserves recoverability and distinguishes
  active runtime identity from historical evidence.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/specs/2026-05-26-pd-to-pdomain-rename-design.md`,
  `_tbd/ocr-container-docs/archive/plans/2026-05-31-pdomain-prefix-finalization.md`,
  current `/workspaces/pdomain` repository names, manifests, remotes, release
  events, and `.pdomain-*` markers. Current practice completed the rename; the
  old disabled-Actions state, ConcaveTrillion URLs, and temporary dependency
  pointers are obsolete.
- **Remaining work:** Use this only as portable migration rationale; do not
  reopen the completed pdomain rename without current runtime evidence.

### 2026-07-13 — Remove the excluded corpus only after preservation gates pass

- **Context:** The red-team ledger covers 210 unique `_tbd/` Markdown paths and
  proposes 185 retirement candidates, but it does not itself authorize
  deletion.
- **Decision:** Treat eventual holding-corpus removal as one corpus-level
  tombstone action. Delete no source until all preservation gates pass.
  Architecture must preserve verified shipped truth, decisions must preserve
  durable rationale, and intent must preserve promising unbuilt work. The
  intent map must retain explicit blockers for unresolved external-state
  questions. The ledger must also be checked against the final disposition
  set.
- **Rationale:** One evidence-backed corpus tombstone avoids repetitive
  per-document entries while preventing wholesale loss of useful material.
- **Evidence:** `_tbd/README.md`, all source paths recorded in
  [`2026-07-13-salvaged-docs-red-team.md`](../research/2026-07-13-salvaged-docs-red-team.md),
  and the preservation and lifecycle rules in `DOCGRAPH.md`. No `_tbd/` source
  has been deleted by this decision.
- **Remaining work:** Complete architecture and intent preservation, resolve
  uncertain rows with owners or owning repositories, verify the ledger, then
  use the docgraph retirement workflow for the approved removal.

### 2026-07-13 — Retired: salvaged holding corpus

- **Old path:** `_tbd/` (222 tracked files: 210 Markdown sources, four design
  assets, and eight empty placeholders).
- **Outcome:** The corpus was red-teamed and deleted after preservation.
- **Superseded by:**
  [`2026-07-13-salvaged-docs-red-team.md`](../research/2026-07-13-salvaged-docs-red-team.md),
  the current architecture records, this decision log, and
  [`intent-map.md`](intent-map.md).
- **Removal commit:** This corpus-retirement commit.
- **Rationale kept:** The ledger preserves every disposition; architecture
  preserves verified shipped behavior; the preceding decision themes preserve
  durable rationale; the intent map preserves promising work and explicit
  blockers for questions that require external state or another repository.
- **Remaining work:** Resolve the retained blocked and owner-decision items in
  their owning systems. Their source documents are retired because they are not
  current truth; their uncertainty remains explicit in the intent map.

### 2026-07-15 — Retired local writing-style document

- **Old path:** `docs/process/writing-style.md`.
- **Outcome:** Superseded, then reinstated the same day (see next entry).
- **Superseded by:** Plugin-owned `write-readably` and
  `edit-for-readability` routing in `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md`.
- **Removal commit:** `7e0a846`.
- **Rationale kept:** The plugin keeps the shared readability standard. Per
  owner direction, this retirement intentionally retires several local-only
  rules: a roughly seventh-grade reading target, rare parentheses, no
  parenthetical em dashes, specific link practices, and command-detail
  deduplication.
- **Remaining work:** None.

### 2026-07-15 — Reinstated local writing-style document

- **Path:** `docs/process/writing-style.md`.
- **Outcome:** Restored. Reverses the same-day retirement above.
- **Reason:** Owner direction to keep a repo-local copy of the writing style.
- **Relationship to plugin routing:** The plugin-owned `write-readably` and
  `edit-for-readability` routing in `AGENTS.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md` stays. The
  local document again carries the repo-local additions the plugin standard
  does not: the roughly seventh-grade reading target, rare parentheses, no
  parenthetical em dashes, specific link practices, and command-detail
  deduplication.
- **Remaining work:** Keep the local document and the managed guidance aligned.

### 2026-07-15 — basedpyright strict mode on the shipped package

- **Context:** The `bind_project.py --strict` comparison flagged this repo's
  basedpyright config as diverging from the shared strict template. The owner
  chose to adopt strict, overriding the 2026-05-17 decision to keep recommended
  mode as canonical.
- **Decision:** Set `typeCheckingMode = "strict"` in `pyproject.toml` and enable
  `reportImplicitOverride` and `reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment`. Add the
  ruff `FA`, `PIE`, and `PTH` families (`PLE` was already covered by `PL`).
  Strict applies to `pdomain_ops` only: the `Makefile` gate already runs
  `basedpyright pdomain_ops --level error`, and the `tests`/`scripts` execution
  environments downgrade the strict-only inference rules so un-annotated test
  code is not forced to full strict. Disable `reportUnusedFunction`, which
  systematically false-positives on FastAPI decorator-registered handlers.
- **Scope of the flip:** Whole-repo strict would surface 1,897 errors, 1,916 of
  them low-value test annotations. Package-scoped strict surfaced 44 new errors,
  all fixed (11 `@override`, 8 stale-ignore removals, `Any`-bound untyped import
  boundaries, a `Generator` return, path narrowing, and pathlib rewrites).
- **Evidence:** `pyproject.toml`, `docs/process/lint-deviations.md`, and a green
  `make ci` (ruff, ruff-format, `basedpyright pdomain_ops --level error` at 0
  errors, 474 tests passing).
- **Remaining work:** none. The `.basedpyright/baseline.json` backlog was pruned
  from 263 to 33 package entries here, then cleared and the file deleted in
  commit `f09d2b7` on 2026-08-08.

### 2026-08-08 — Delete resolved issue reports after promoting their specifics

- **Context:** The first two issue reports in this repository reached
  `Resolution: Resolved` and needed a retirement path. An earlier attempt kept
  both files in a "Resolved issues" index. The owner rejected that: git history
  already preserves a resolved report, so a second copy in the live tree is
  duplicated state that goes stale.
- **Decision:** On resolution, promote only the specifics a reader still needs
  into the architecture or process doc that owns them. Then delete the report,
  drop its README pointer, and append a tombstone here.
  [`docs/issues/README.md`](../issues/README.md) indexes open work only.
- **Rationale:** A resolved report's durable content is a small number of rules
  and current-state facts, which belong in the doc a reader consults anyway. The
  reproduction steps, hypotheses, and evidence are history, and git holds them.
  Keeping the file forces every future edit to maintain a document nobody
  consults.
- **Evidence:** Owner direction on 2026-08-08, reversing the retire-in-place
  decision recorded earlier the same day. Both reports were deleted with their
  specifics already promoted to
  [`lint-deviations.md`](../process/lint-deviations.md), and
  `docgraph check --strict` returned zero issues afterward.
- **Remaining work:** none. Apply this rule to future `Kind: issue` retirements.

### 2026-08-08 Retired: desktop._noop_app was dead code kept by a stale docstring

- **Old path:** `docs/issues/2026-08-07-desktop-noop-app-dead-code.md`
- **Outcome:** implemented — the function was removed in commit `d73c331`.
- **Superseded by:** N/A
- **Removal commit:** `64ac883`
- **Rationale kept:** [`lint-deviations.md`](../process/lint-deviations.md)
  records why `reportUnusedFunction` stays disabled package-wide, that the
  disable hides genuine dead functions, and that none is known today.
- **Remaining work:** none.

### 2026-08-08 Retired: 33 pre-existing strict diagnostics sit in the basedpyright baseline

- **Old path:** `docs/issues/2026-08-07-basedpyright-strict-baseline.md`
- **Outcome:** implemented — all 33 diagnostics fixed and
  `.basedpyright/baseline.json` deleted in commit `f09d2b7`. The fixes removed
  six suppressions and added none.
- **Superseded by:** N/A
- **Removal commit:** `64ac883`
- **Rationale kept:** [`lint-deviations.md`](../process/lint-deviations.md)
  carries the durable rule: the package type-checks clean under strict with no
  baseline, and no baseline is to be reintroduced.
- **Remaining work:** none.

### 2026-07-21 — Track work in governed issue documents

- **Context:** GitHub reported zero open issues. The repository already had a
  docgraph-governed `docs/issues/` scaffold, but its template covered only
  defects and investigations. Repository guidance still treated GitHub issue
  state, milestones, and labels as workflow authority.
- **Decision:** Use governed reports under
  [`docs/issues/`](../issues/README.md) as the only issue tracker. The README is
  the sole open and resolved index. Issue metadata keeps type, priority, area,
  triage, resolution, and dependency relationships separate. GitHub Issues and
  labels are not authoritative and are not synchronized. This supersedes the
  2026-07-13 direction to reconcile workflow metadata with live GitHub labels.
  It preserves that decision's rationale for separate axes and machine-checkable
  dependency relationships.
- **Rationale:** One versioned, docgraph-checked source prevents status drift
  between repository documents and an external tracker. The broader schema
  supports bugs, regressions, investigations, features, chores, and docs work.
- **Evidence:** `gh issue list --state open --limit 100` returned an empty list
  on 2026-07-21. `docs/issues/README.md`, `docs/issues/TEMPLATE.md`,
  `docgraph.toml`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CONVENTIONS.md` define the replacement
  workflow.
- **Remaining work:** None in this repository. Any future cross-system export
  requires a new owner-approved design and cannot become a second status
  source.

### 2026-08-08 Retired: issues → docs/ roadmap migration plan

- **Old path:** `docs/plans/2026-07-14-issues-to-docs-roadmap-migration.md`, on
  the local branch `plan/issues-to-docs-roadmap-migration` (tip `29c66c2`,
  branched from `30b579b`). The branch also carried
  `docs/handoff/2026-07-14-103613-issues-to-docs-migration.md`.
- **Outcome:** superseded. The migration happened, but through a different
  design, and the branch was never merged.
- **Superseded by:** the governed `docs/issues/` tracker, established by the
  2026-07-21 decision above and by shared-devtools
  `docs/specs/2026-07-20-git-managed-issue-intake-design.md`.
- **Removal commit:** branch deleted 2026-08-08; commits remain reachable from
  `29c66c2` until git prunes them.
- **Rationale kept:** three of the plan's premises are now false. It targeted
  `docs/roadmap.md` plus a `docs/backlog/` folder per repo; no repository has a
  `docs/backlog/`, and the 150 migrated records live in `docs/issues/` instead.
  It required GitHub Issues to stay enabled as an intake inbox with each issue
  closed and labeled `migrated`; the issues were deleted instead, so
  `gh issue list --state all` returns nothing on a migrated repo. Its Phase 3
  proposed archiving `pd-ocr-labeler` and `pd-ocr-trainer` as dead; both took
  commits on 2026-08-08. The plan's red-team findings on docgraph vocabulary,
  `--strict` as the only real gate, and merge-before-close were absorbed into
  the shared intake spec.
- **Remaining work:** two cleanup items from its Task 2.3 are still open and
  moved to the intent map: vestigial `wip/ship-issue*` remote branches, and
  vestigial `bot:*`, `model:*`, `model-effort:*`, and `recurring:*` labels.

### 2026-11-07 — Revalidate the decision log against repository evidence

- **Scope:** This check preserves the original decisions and their historical
  evidence. It does not recheck every sibling repository, external service,
  GitHub label, or past test count.
- **Verified:** `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  still enforce package-scoped strict basedpyright with error-only failure,
  `reportUnusedFunction = false`, and no tracked baseline. `make ci` passed
  with zero basedpyright errors or warnings and 464 tests passed, one skipped
  because Modal is absent. This confirms the current gate; it does not prove
  the absence of every unused function.
- **Historical corrections:** The July 13 lint entry's recommended-mode claim
  was superseded by the July 15 strict-mode decision. The July 15 entry's
  claim of 1,916 test errors within 1,897 total errors is inconsistent; those
  historical counts are not current evidence. The July 21 issue-tracking
  decision was superseded in part by the August 8 rule to index only open
  reports and delete resolved reports after preservation. Its GitHub-label
  assumptions are historical, not current tracking instructions.
- **Release evidence:** Commit `7ff9c7d` deleted this repository's GitHub
  workflows. The July 13 release entry's `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  reference is historical. Current local release sequencing is implemented in
  `scripts/do-release.sh` and `scripts/release-common.sh`; this check did not
  publish a release or verify remote index publication.
- **Corpus evidence:** Commit `30b579b` removed 222 `_tbd/` files, including
  the exact 210 Markdown paths preserved by the research ledger. This
  completes the earlier exclusion and preservation sequence. The original
  removal-commit placeholder resolves to `30b579b`. Remaining external-state
  questions stay in [`intent-map.md`](intent-map.md).
- **Related evidence:** The current suppression inventory is in
  [`lint-deviations.md`](../process/lint-deviations.md). The historical ledger
  records its November verification scope without refreshing July claims
  about sibling implementations.

### 2026-11-09 Retired: Book-contracts extraction handoff (2026-09-02)

- Old path: `docs/handoff/2026-09-02-045132-book-contracts-extraction.md`
- Outcome: superseded
- Superseded by: [extraction plan](../plans/2026-09-01-extract-book-contracts-and-retire-pd-repos.md),
  whose 2026-11-07 verification section records the outcome
- Removal commit: `674eb5da`
- Rationale kept: Contracts publish to the package index, now at v0.3.0. Book-tools,
  pgdp-api-client, the labeler, source-data and ocr-cli pin it there. Synth has no contracts
  dependency, so its repoint was not needed. The layout spec corrections are `3f1b53e` and
  `43615bc`. The contracts architecture overview records the structural Protocols in
  `legacy_projection` and the vendored `spdx_licenses.json`. One reason lived only in the
  handoff. Book-tools registers its `BoundingBox` image-ops provider in `geometry/image_ops.py`,
  not `geometry/__init__.py`, so that importing `pdomain_book_tools.geometry` does not load cv2.
- Remaining work: Task 2, data rescue and retiring the `pd-` repos, is in current state and the plan

### 2026-11-12 Retired: F2 and Gutenberg layout regions

- Old path: `docs/plans/2026-11-07-f2-and-gutenberg-layout-regions.md`
- Outcome: implemented
- Superseded by: [layout review](../architecture/layout-review.md)
- Removal commit: `1ffce80`
- Rationale kept: Contracts `v0.2.1` (`94e4eef`) published the text hints. The 92-test proof, eight Chromium checks, consumer gates, and remote master commits are in the architecture doc. Partial corpus quality and model training were never this plan's claim.
- Remaining work: accepted corpus quality and a usable checkpoint, in the [roadmap](intent-map.md)

### 2026-11-12 Retired: P3 and F2 alignment with API-driven review

- Old path: `docs/plans/2026-11-08-p3-f2-review-api.md`
- Outcome: implemented
- Superseded by: [layout review](../architecture/layout-review.md)
- Removal commit: `1ffce80`
- Rationale kept: The nine-page proof ran 152 public operations and preserved 1,530 OCR words. Contracts `v0.3.0` is commit `1bd8261`. The 2026-11-08 "not merged" line was true that day. On 2026-11-12 the proof commits were on sibling masters. Per-page alignment states stay in the architecture doc.
- Remaining work: ambiguous, changed, and exhausted pages, in the [roadmap](intent-map.md)

### 2026-11-12 Retired: Source tabs and page refresh

- Old path: `docs/plans/2026-11-08-source-tabs-and-page-refresh.md`
- Outcome: implemented
- Superseded by: [layout review](../architecture/layout-review.md)
- Removal commit: `1ffce80`
- Rationale kept: Six tabs, generation reset, and the nine-page source preview measurements are in the architecture doc. Labeler commit `a96cff907` is on master. Wheel `0.6.1.dev14+ga96cff907` was the installed proof build.
- Remaining work: unresolved formatting on the pages listed in the architecture doc

### 2026-11-12 Retired: Suite status and where to spend agent time

- Old path: `docs/plans/2026-09-12-suite-status-and-agent-allocation.md`
- Outcome: superseded
- Superseded by: [intent map](intent-map.md) and [layout review](../architecture/layout-review.md)
- Removal commit: `1ffce80`
- Rationale kept: The September survey's release blockers were already stale on 2026-11-07. Book-tools `v0.30.1`, training `v0.3.0`, and pgdp-measure `v0.1.0` had local tags. Region review client code and geometry proposal code existed. The three-week agent split was execution scaffolding and was not copied. The unsettled items that remain are production proposal wiring, accepted corpus quality, a usable model, the synthesizer dataset contract, and where layout training runs.
- Remaining work: those items, in the [roadmap](intent-map.md)
