"""Default stage registration for pdomain-ops LocalStageDispatcher.

Wires DocTR and Tesseract CPU runners from pdomain-book-tools into the
dispatcher.  Call once at app startup::

    from pdomain_ops.gpu import LocalStageDispatcher, register_default_stages
    dispatcher = LocalStageDispatcher()
    register_default_stages(dispatcher)

The stage callable signature expected by LocalStageDispatcher is::

    async def impl(page_id: str, device: str, **kwargs) -> dict

Kwargs forwarded by pdomain-ocr-simple-gui (and any other caller):

* ``image_path: str`` — path to the image file to OCR
* ``engine: str`` — which engine to use (``"doctr"`` / ``"tesseract"``).
  Defaults to ``"doctr"``.
* ``language: str`` — language hint (e.g. ``"eng"``)

Stage registry layout
---------------------
The ``(stage_id, device)`` registry key uses the *hardware* device concept,
not the OCR engine name.  Engine selection is a runtime parameter passed via
``kwargs["engine"]``:

* ``("ocr", "cpu")`` — single impl that dispatches to DocTR or Tesseract
  depending on ``kwargs.get("engine", "doctr")``.

If pdomain-book-tools OCR functions are not available at import time this
module does *not* raise; unavailable engines are handled gracefully inside
the impl (an ``ImportError`` is re-raised with a clear message).
